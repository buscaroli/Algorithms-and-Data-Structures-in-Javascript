These algorithms represent examples of the following generic
paradigms (bear in mind the names of the paradigms ARE NOT
OFFICIAL NAMES). The aim of these classes of algorithms is to
find a way to solve problems with a better Time Complexity than
the simpler straight-forward nested loops versions.
They are:
* Frequency Counter Pattern :   where keys are stored in an object 
                                and their frequency is used to solve
                                the problem.
* Multiple Pointers Pattern:    where more than one pointer is used to
                                keep track of the elements of an array.
* Sliding Window Pattern:       where a group of contiguous elements of
                                the array (referred to as a window or slot)
                                is used to solve the problem. The window
                                is identified by a starting index and an
                                ending index and it usually shifts through
                                the whole array and it's used to identify
                                matching patterns.
